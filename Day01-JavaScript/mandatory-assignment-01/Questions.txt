Mandatory Assignment 1: Opening Hours

CASE: a local shop

Design a one html landing page for the opening hours of a shop. Imagine that it is some sort of local shop, say a barbershop, a florist, a butcher or similar.

The showowner wants to tell costumers whether the shop is open today or not.
The website must give feedback such as: "The shop is open today from [+ open hours]" or "The shop is closed now, but ... "

If the shop is not open, there should be a link to an online offer of some kind.
